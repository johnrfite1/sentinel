# Sentinel — project gate. Run this before claiming anything is green.

# Usage:
#   ./scripts/test.sh          fast profile (fuzz 1024)
#   ./scripts/test.sh --gate   deep profile for gate evidence (fuzz 20000)
#
# AGENTS.md: "a tool reporting success is not a substitute for checking its output",
# and a runner should fail on error output it does not explicitly expect. This script
# therefore fails on a non-zero exit from ANY stage, not just the last one.

GATE PASSED

Coverage boundary — what this gate is evidence for right now (house rule 4):
  covered : §5 typed payload schemas, canonical EIP-712 hashes, domain separation,
            bound-field mutation sensitivity, fail-closed enum defaults, secret hygiene
  NOT yet : signatures and recovery, SentinelVault, nonce consumption, replay and tamper
            invariants, decoders, the Anvil pipeline, the conformance engine, the corpus
Gate S1 requires the "NOT yet" line to be empty of its first five items.
